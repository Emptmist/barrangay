                        <p class="txtvid">Serving and helping others is a noble and fulfilling endeavor that brings positive impact and
                            joy to both the giver and the receiver. It is a selfless act of compassion, empathy,
                            and kindness that goes beyond personal interests and focuses on the well-being and welfare of others.</p>
                        <p class="txtvid">Being of service to others involves actively identifying the needs and concerns of individuals
                            or communities and taking action to address them. It can take many forms, such as volunteering, 
                            providing assistance, lending a listening ear, offering guidance, or simply being there for someone in times
                            of need. It requires a genuine desire to make a difference and a willingness to devote time, energy, and
                            resources to support others.Helping people encompasses various aspects of life, including physical, emotional,
                            and social well-being.</p>

                <div class="alltext">
                    <p>During the Spanish time, this barangay is the only place where a big rice mill is found where residents of the nearby barrios mill their palay into rice. The name “Molino” is derived from a local version of the word rice mill.</p>
                    <p>Molino IV was originally named “Pulong Mabilog” a tagalog translation of a “Circle Island” because according to the elders and legitimate residents of this place, the area looks like a circle island. The time it was named Molino IV when, in 1991, through a Congressional Act, considering the increase of its population, it was divided into seven (7) Barangays and the fourth Barangay was named Molino IV.</p>
                    <p>The first known head of the barrio is Jaime Sapanghila before it was divided into seven (7) Barangays. He was then called the “Punong Barangay”. However, as early as 1966, the head of the barrio was called “Barrio Liutenant” or “Tenyente del Barrio”. It was David Camatigue who headed the barrio at that time.</p>
                    <p>The first Election was held in 1994 wherein Jaime Sapanghila was proclaimed as winner based on the 1987 Philippine Constitution. He was then called the “Punong Barangay” by the Local Government Code of 1991, who completed three (3) terms until 2007, succeeded by the then elected Rizaldy Remulla who served for two (2) terms until 2013, until a new “Punong Barangay” was elected on 2013 Barangay Election in the person of Jeffrey P. Campaña.</p>
                    <p>Molino IV has an area of 1,028.6365 hectares (per approved DENR), and is bounded to the South, by Barangay Salawag of Dasmariñas City, to the North, of Barangay Molino III of the same City of Bacoor, to the East, of Barangay Pasong Buaya of Imus and to the West, of Alabang, Las Piñas City. Based on the 2019 conducted mapping, Molino IV has a total population of 61,494 with 21,555 households, wherein approximately 45% were males and 55% were females.</p>
                    <p>The main source of income and livelihood before of its residents were farming, fishing, animal raising, and gathering firewoods making it into charcoals and selling it to “bakaries” or known as bakeries.</p>
                    <p>Subdivisions started to sprout in the area in the early 80's where Duplex Homes was the first subdivision constructed, followed by Maryhomes whose name was formerly Pag-ibig homes. The first church was established in 1955 known as the Mataas na Sampaloc Baptist Church.</p>
                    <p>Subdivisions flourished in year 1980 onwards until huge commercial establishments were constructed in the area like the SM Supermart and Vista Mall. Right now, Vista Place is being constructed in Daang Hari. Said construction and establishment of business structures has made a great change to the classification of the barangay and lifestyle of the residents therein. Now it is partly commercialized causing problems on traffic in the area and the influx of residents or settlers who chose Molino IV as their abode and permanent residency.</p>
                    <p>Molino IV is also known for the home of the National Artist in the name of Eduardo Castrillo, who has sculptured a great number of statues over the country, one of which is the statue of Aguinaldo situated at the Aguinaldo Shrine of Kawit, Cavite, and the newly erected Statue at the City Hall of Bacoor representing the history of the City.</p>
